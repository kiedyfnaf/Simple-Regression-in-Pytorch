# Simple-Regression-in-Pytorch
Made in GoogleColab but if it doesnt work i included a python file as well. The model simply chooses the best weights for each power of x so it learns to "copy" function as best as it can, isnt very complicated if you want higher powers or more complicated model feel free to change it i hope i made the code as understandable as it can. All hard encoded things are in caps and they can be changed in the first few lines.
